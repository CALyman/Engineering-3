# Engineering 3 Repo:

It's engineering three,

we made it this far

and engineering three

has a much higher bar.

---

Git is nice,

Lack of homework is nicer.

I cut my finger 

on a potato slicer.

---

There was some blood,

but that's alright.

I think about 

existential crises at night.

---

So that's my jam,

and that's the tea,

man am I excited for

engineering three.
